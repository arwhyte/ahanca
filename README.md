# Ahanca

## About

Ahanca (From the Portuguese word for pluck, "arranca".  Pronounced as "uh-HAHNK-uh" or in IPA: 
\[a.ɦˈɐ̃n.kɐ\].) is a Caliper event data transformer. Information is plucked from event data 
expressed in one version of the Caliper format and expressed in another one.

Ahanca aims to allow support for future versions of Caliper simply by adding information about
those versions to its JSON file of version mappings.  It may also support xAPI statements as well.  
It has the potential of being a general JSON transformation tool, even for data that is not 
related to learning analytics.
